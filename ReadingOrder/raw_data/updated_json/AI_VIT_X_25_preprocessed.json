            "text": "Trivia questions from quiz bowl have been previously used in other question answering tasks (Boyd-Graber , 2012). Quiz bowl questions are paragraph length and pyramidal. 10 A number of different aspects of this problem have been carefully studied, typically using classifiers over a pre-defined set of answers (Iyyer , 2014) and studying incremental answering to answer as quickly as possible (Boyd-Graber , 2012) or using reinforcement learning to model opponent behavior (He , 2016). These competitive challenges are not present in our single-sentence question setting. Developing joint models for multisentence reasoning for questions and answer documents is an important area for future work."
