We then measure word co-occurrences in the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that\nlanguage models produce text of differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation [HZJ+19], we explored\nhow race impacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet [BES10] for the words which co-occurred\ndisproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with positive scores indicating positive\nwords (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores indicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid:\n-87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral words (eg. sloping, chalet)."

An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a<br>billion parameters [JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling<br>up parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:<br>213 million parameters [VSP+ 17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [DCLT18], 1.5 billion parameters<br>[RWC+ 19], 8 billion parameters [SPP+ 19], 11 billion parameters [RSR + 19], and most recently 17 billion parameters<br>[Tur20]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of<br>increasing models' capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the<br>conditional computation framework [BLC13] and specifically, the mixture-of-experts method [SMM+ 17] has been<br>used to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [AJF19],<br>though only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases<br>computation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [Gra16] and<br>the universal transformer [DGV+ 18]. Our work focuses on the first approach (scaling compute and parameters together,<br>by straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ<br>this strategy.</p>",

            "text": "Several lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\nbillion parameters [JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\n213 million parameters [VSP+ 17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [DCLT18], 1.5 billion parameters\n[RWC+ 19], 8 billion parameters [SPP+ 19], 11 billion parameters [RSR + 19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\n[Tur20]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\nincreasing models' capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\nconditional computation framework [BLC13] and specifically, the mixture-of-experts method [SMM+ 17] has been\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [AJF19],\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [Gra16] and\nthe universal transformer [DGV+ 18]. Our work focuses on the first approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\nthis strategy."

            "text": "Another approach to increasing generality and transfer-learning capability in language models is multi-task learning\n[Car97], which fine-tunes on a mixture of downstream tasks together, rather than separately updating the weights for\neach one. If successful multi-task learning could allow a single model to be used for many tasks without updating the\nweights (similar to our in-context learning approach), or alternatively could improve sample efficiency when updating\nthe weights for a new task. Multi-task learning has shown some promising initial results [LGH+ 15, LSP+ 18] and\nmulti-stage fine-tuning has recently become a standardized part of SOTA results on some datasets [PFB18] and pushed\nthe boundaries on certain tasks [KKS+20], but is still limited by the need to manually curate collections of datasets and\nset up training curricula. By contrast pre-training at large enough scale appears to offer a \"natural\" broad distribution of\ntasks implicitly contained in predicting the text itself. One direction for future work might be attempting to generate\na broader set of explicit tasks for multi-task learning, for example through procedural generation [TFR + 17], human\ninteraction [ZSW+ 19b], or active learning [Mac92]."

Using the original WebText as a proxy for high-quality documents, we trained a classifier\nto distinguish these from raw Common Crawl. We then used this classifier to re-sample Common Crawl by\nprioritizing documents which were predicted by the classifier to be higher quality. The classifier is trained\nusing logistic regression classifier with features from Spark's standard tokenizer and HashingTF 10 For the\npositive examples, we used a collection of curated datasets such as WebText, Wikiedia, and our web books\ncorpus as the positive examples, and for the negative examples, we used unfiltered Common Crawl. We used\nthis classifier to score Common Crawl documents. We kept each document in our dataset iff"

You may feel free to ask similar questions of your Latin American friends . The French think of conversation as an art form, and they enjoy the value of lively discussions as well as disagreements · For them, arguments can be interesting and they can cover pretty much or any topic ---- as long as they occur in are respectful and intelligent manner · In the United States , business people like to discuss a wide range of topics , including opinions about work,family ,hobbies, and politics. In Japan, China, and Korea,however , people are much more private. They do not share much about their thoughts , feelings, or emotions because they feel that doing SO might take away from the harmonious business relationship they're trying to build.
