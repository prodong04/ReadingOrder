            "text": "Table 8 summarizes the results from this ablation study on a ViT-B/16 model. As we can see, while\nthere is a large gap between the performances of the model with no positional embedding and mod-\nels with positional embedding, there is little to no difference between different ways of encoding\npositional information. We speculate that since our Transformer encoder operates on patch-level\ninputs, as opposed to pixel-level, the differences in how to encode spatial information is less impor-\ntant. More precisely, in patch-level inputs, the spatial dimensions are much smaller than the original\npixel-level inputs, e.g., 14 x 14 as opposed to 224 x 224, and learning to represent the spatial re-\nlations in this resolution is equally easy for these different positional encoding strategies. Even so,\nthe specific pattern of position embedding similarity learned by the network depends on the training\nhyperparameters (Figure 10)."
