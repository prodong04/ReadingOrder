For Q we included L2 weight decay of 10-2 and used a discount factor of 2 = 0.99. For the soft target updates we used T = 0.001. The neural networks used the rectified non-linearity (Glorot , 2011) for all hidden layers. The final output layer of the actor was a tanh layer, to bound the actions. The low-dimensional networks had 2 hidden layers with 400 and 300 units respectively (2 130,000 parameters). Actions were not included until the 2nd hidden layer of Q. When learning from pixels we used 3 convolutional layers (no pooling) with 32 filters at each layer. This was followed by two fully connected layers with 200 units (2 430,000 parameters). The final layer weights and biases of both the actor and critic were initialized from a uniform distribution [-3 x 10-3 3 x 10-3] and [3 x 10-4 3 x 10 4] for the , , low dimensional and pixel cases respectively. This was to ensure the initial outputs for the policy and value estimates were near zero. The other layers were initialized from uniform distributions [- V 1 V , V] where f is the fan-in of the layer. The actions were not included until the fully-connected layers. We trained with minibatch sizes of 64 for the low dimensional problems and 16 on pixels. We used a replay buffer size of 106."

The pendulum should be brought to the upright position and balanced. Torque limits prevent the agent from swinging the pendulum up directly. reacher3daFixedTarget Agent is required to move a 7-DOF human-like arm to a fixed target position. reacher3daRandomTarget Agent is required to move a 7-DOF human-like arm from random starting locations to random target positions. reacher Agent is required to move a 3-DOF arm from random starting locations to random target positions. reacherSingle Agent is required to move a simple 1-DOF arm from random starting locations to random target positions. reacherObstacle Agent is required to move a 5-DOF arm around an obstacle to a randomized target position. walker2d Agent should move forward as quickly as possible with a bipedal walker constrained to the plane without falling down or pitching the torso too far forward or backward."
