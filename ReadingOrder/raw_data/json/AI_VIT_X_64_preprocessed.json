The HNeat Pixel score is obtained by using the special 8 color channel representation of the Atari emulator that represents an object label map at each channel. This method relies heavily on finding a deterministic sequence of states that represents a successful exploit. It is unlikely that strategies learnt in this way will generalize to random perturbations; therefore the algorithm was only evaluated on the highest scoring single episode. In contrast, our algorithm is evaluated on E-greedy control sequences, and must therefore generalize across a wide variety of possible situations. Nevertheless, we show that on all the games, except Space Invaders, not only our max evaluation results (row 8), but also our average results (row 4) achieve better performance."
