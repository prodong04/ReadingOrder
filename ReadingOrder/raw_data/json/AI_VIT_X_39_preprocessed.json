            "text": "Named entity recognition. The CoNLL-2003 English benchmark dataset for NER is a collection of documents from Reuters newswire articles, annotated with four entity types: person, location, organization, and miscellaneous. We train models on CoNLL-03 training data on test on three datasets: 1) ConLL-03 testing data, 2) ACE Phase 2 (2001-02) and ACE-2003 data, and 3) MUC7 Formal Run test set. We adopt the BIO2 annotation standard, as well as all the preprocessing steps described in (Wang and Manning, 2013). We use a comprehensive set of discrete features that comes with the standard distribution of the Stanford NER model (Finkel , 2005). A total of 437,905 discrete features were generated for the CoNLL2003 training dataset. In addition, 50-dimensional vectors for each word of a five-word context are added and used as continuous features. With these features as input, we trained a conditional random field (CRF) with exactly the same setup as the CRFjoin model of (Wang and Manning, 2013)."
